Description: Source for the batman-advanced kernel module
 This package provides the source code for the batman-adv-source kernel modules.
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.
 .
 B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is a new routing
 protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. B.A.T.M.A.N.-advanced is the
 implementation of this protocol on ISO/OSI Layer 2, allowing mesh networks to
 be used as a virtual switch. With this approach, LANs and WANs can be easily
 integrated, and more protocols (like DHCP, IPv6) are supported.

Description: DKMS Source for the batman-advanced kernel module
 This package contains the source for the batman-adv-source kernel modules,
 packaged with approriate configuration for DKMS to build new modules
 dynamically.
