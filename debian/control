Description: Source for the batman-advanced kernel module
 This package provides the source code for the batman-adv-source kernel modules.
 The batman-adv-source package is also required in order to make use of these
 modules. Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

 B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is a new routing 
 protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. B.A.T.M.A.N.-advanced is the 
 implementation of  this protocol on ISO/OSI Layer 2, allowing mesh networks 
 to be used as a virtual  switch. With this approach, LANs and WANs can be 
 easily integrated, and more protocols (like DHCP, IPv6) are supported.
